# Selenium-Shell

If you've worked with the DOS (on Microsoft Windows) or the Terminal (on Linux/Mac), you know what a shell is, and what benefits does it bring.

Software shells are environments, typical of operating systems, where you execute commands, one at a time.  You'll see the output of each command, immediately following its submission.  The design is simple, and you can virtually 'count' the number of features.  Essentially, simplicity is its power, when speaking about shells.  That is a benefit, unparalleled by any other solution.

Most shells also allow programming on top of what it offers already.  Selenium-Shell also does.

Selenium-Shell enables its user to perform a web test/scenario through its step-wise execution capabilities.  At every step, watch the result, as you slowly build up the sceanario.  That makes it the ideal tool for newbies to get started with automating tests using Selenium web driver, it also helps you get more adventurous, and efficient with automation, . The shell provides you with not just a very desirable handiness, but also great insights into the process of automation.

Some of the core features of this tool...

- Stepwise execution of selenium-driven web tests.
- Interleaving manual steps with automation.
- Extremely simplified web element searches.
- Record and playback facilities - great replacement for Selenium IDE.
- Handles selenium actions class.
- Handles existing browser session well.
- Well-suited to run browser compatibility tests.
- Get all elements meeting the criteria.
- Get attribute values of the "indexed" web-element
- Highlight currently "indexed" element on the browser.
- Basic verification added (equality, containment of strings)
- "eval" to handle all other "unsupported features" (available in Selenium).
- Self-documented.  Type "?" inside the shell.  Type "?<command>" to get help on the command.

How to start
=========

1.  Watch the videos first, if you've not already.  
2.  Install Python2.7 from python.org.  By default, python will be installed in C:\Python27 folder.
3.  Install following python modules using pip (C:\Python27\Scripts\pip.exe install) = selenium, cmd
4.  Add C:\Python27 to the system environment path.
5. Fire up the shell (double-click on SeleniumShell.py, or from a command prompt/terminal, say "python SeleniumShell.py")
6.  Make sure config.txt contains the right set of values (geckodriver_path, primarily)
7.  Start by typing "?" in the shell.
8.  Rest should be self-explanatory.  If it isn't, please revert.
